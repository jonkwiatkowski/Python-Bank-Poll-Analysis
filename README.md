## PyBank
Analysis of the financial records for a bank. The dataset involved contains "Date" and Profit/Loss"

A python script was created to calculate the following values:

* Total number of months included in the dataset

* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes

* Greatest increase in profits over the entire period and the month in which it occurred

* Greatest decrease in profits over the entire period and the month in which it occurred

## Summary of Results - PyBank
Over the 86 months included in our data, the company lost an average of $8,311.11. The greatest profit occurred between July and August of 2016, an increase in $1,862,002 and the greatest loss occurred between January and February of 2014, a loss of $1,825,558.

* Total number of votes cast

* List of candidates who received votes

* Percentage of votes each candidate won
